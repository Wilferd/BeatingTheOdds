# Beating the Odds

There’s a saying when it comes to gambling that “the house always wins.” The motivation for our project is knowing how often Vegas predictions are right for the outcomes of NBA games. We are interested in sports betting and want to display the results for the NBA and compare actual outcomes to predicted outcomes. For every NBA game, there are countless statistics that oddsmakers come up with such as money lines, spreads, favorites, expected payouts, etc. Our goal is to distill this information into helpful visualizations that show how teams perform vs how they are expected to perform.

- D3  
- Bootstrap 5 
- JQuery

## How to interact with the visualizations

- **Bar Chart:** Hovering in the line chart shows odds in the bar chart
-  **Spoke Diagram:** Click on a team on the outside of the circle to swap to that team's head to head matchup data
