## Libraries
All of the visualizations are created using d3, html, and javascript. Most of the code has been written by us except for the Date Range Picker for filtering the time.
- D3  
- Bootstrap 5 
- JQuery
- [Date Range Picker](https://www.daterangepicker.com/)

## How to interact with the visualizations
- **Line Chart:** Filter the teams and dates
- **Bar Chart:** Hovering in the line chart shows odds in the bar chart
-  **Spoke Diagram:** Click on a team on the outside of the circle to swap to that team's head to head matchup data
